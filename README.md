1. Download the HICO-DET dataset and merge it to hico_20160224_det
2. Use files in /util to generate graph_test_multi.json and graph_train_multi.json
   We also provide them in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1m9hB5Rwe15wpMNpzdcjgV1TMr-Gipv47?usp=drive_link
3. Run main_multi.py to train and eval the model.
4. Use eval_multi.py to evaluate the result.
